> Say: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind,  
> The King (or Ruler) of Mankind,  
> The God (or judge) of Mankind,-  
> From the mischief of the Whisperer (of Evil), who withdraws (after his
whisper),-  
> (The same) who whispers into the hearts of Mankind,-  
> Among Jinn and among men.  

> —Quran, sura 114 (Al-Nas), ayat 1–6
